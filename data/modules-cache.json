botpress-wit\nThe easiest way to create a Wit.ai bot with Botpress\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nbotpress install wit\n```\n\nThe Wit.ai module should now be available in your bot UI\n\n## Features\n\nThis module has two modes: **Understanding** (message API) and **Stories** (converse API).\n\n### Understanding\n\nThis mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the Wit.ai middleware.\n\nEvents will have a `wit` property populated with the extracted `entities` and the `context`.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({'wit.entities.intent[0].value': 'weather'}, (event, next) => {\n  console.log('>> Weather')\n  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Weather intent')\n})\n```\n\n### Stories\n\nThis mode will run your Wit.ai stories automatically given that you defined the **Actions** in botpress.\n\nFor more information about Actions and how they are run, make sure to read [node-wit](https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit)'s documentation.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you created a conversation flow on Wit.ai's User Interface and want it to run automatically in your bot. This is great for non-programmers.\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\n// Implement your Actions like this\nbp.wit.actions['getWeather'] = request => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    bp.logger.info('Get Weather called', request)\n    // Do something here\n    resolve(request.context)\n  })\n}\n\n// You need to call this method once you are done implementing the Actions\nbp.wit.reinitializeClient()\n```\n\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nWe have a [Public Chatroom](https://gitter.im/botpress/core), everybody is invited to come and share ideas, issues or simply get in touch.\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-wit is licensed under

botpress-api.ai\nThe easiest way to create an API.AI bot with Botpress\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nbotpress install api.ai\n```\n\nThe API.AI module should now be available in your bot UI\n\n## Features\n\nThis module has two modes: **Default** (amend incoming events) and **Fulfillment** (respond automatically).\n\n### Default Mode\n\nThis mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the API.AI middleware.\n\nEvents will have an `nlp` property populated with the extracted metadata from API.AI.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({'nlp.action': 'smalltalk.person'}, (event, next) => {\n  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'My name is James')\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfillment Mode\n\nThis mode will check if there's an available response in the `fulfillment` property of the API.AI response and respond automatically. No code required.\n\n**Note:** Works only with single-response text. We do not support Cards and quick responses.\n\n**Tip:** This is great for non-programmers or if all your conversation logic is hosted on API.AI.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nWe have a [Public Chatroom](https://gitter.im/botpress/core), everybody is invited to come and share ideas, issues or simply get in touch.\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-api.ai is licensed under

botpress-broadcast\n\nProvides an interface and APIs to schedule and send messages to your bot audience.\n\n**Support connectors: ** [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n<img src='/assets/screenshot-broadcast.png' height='300px'>\n\n## Get started\n\n```\nbotpress install broadcast\n```\n\nThe broadcast module should now be available in your bot UI, and the APIs exposed.\n\n## Features\n\n### Send according to Users timezone\n\nYou can decide wether the scheduled time is abolute to the bot's time or to individual users. If no timezone information available for the user, GMT is chosen.\n\n### Send as Javascript snippet\n\nInstead of sending text, you can decide the behavior of the sending function and do basically anything. The function will be called for every message (so for every user).\n\nVariables exposed: \n\n- `bp` botpress instance\n- `userId` the userId to send the message to\n- `platform` the platform on which the user is on\n\nThe built-in Facebook Messenger snippets are example of Javascript execution (see UI).\n\n### Filtering\n\nYou can apply filters to the broadcasts. Filters are small javascript functions that will be evaluated before sending the broadcast to a user. The condition is called for every users the broadcast is scheduled to.\n\nVariables exposed to the filter function:\n- `bp` botpress instance\n- `userId` the userId to send the message to\n- `platform` the platform on which the user is on\n\nThe function needs to return a **boolean** or a **Promise of a boolean**.\n\n**Note:** Starting your function with `return ` is optional.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Send a message only to users on Facebook\n\n```js\n[\"platform === 'facebook'\"]\n```\n\n##### Send a message only to subscribed users \n\n**Note**: Assuming your bot has a `subscriptions` table that holds userId and platform\n\n```js\n// in your bot's index.js\n\nbp.isUserSubscribed = (userId, platform) => {\n  return bp.db.get()\n  .then(knex => \n    knex('subscriptions')\n    .where({ userId, platform })\n    .select('count(*) as count')\n    then().get(0).then(({count}) => count > 0)\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js\n[\"bp.isUserSubscribed(userId)\"]\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- User segmentation\n\n## API\n\n### `GET /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts`\n\nReturns a list of the scheduled broadcasts.\n\n### `PUT /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts`\n\nSchedules a new broadcast.\n\n#### Body\n\n```js\n{\n  date: string, // *required*, 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n  time: string, // *required*, 'HH:mm'\n  timezone: null|int, // null (users timezone), or integer (absolute timezone)\n  type: string, // *required*, 'text' or 'javascript'\n  content: string // *required*, the text to be sent or the javascript code to execute,\n  filters: [string] // filtering conditions, Javascript code\n}\n```\n\n#### Response\n\n```\n\"Hello, Human!\"\n```\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts`\n\nUpdate an existing broadcast. Same as PUT except that `id` is also necessary. You can't modify a processing broadcast.\n\n### `DELETE /api/botpress-broadcast/broadcasts/:id`\n\nDelete an existing broadcast. You can't delete a processing broadcast.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nWe have a [Public Chatroom](https://gitter.im/botpress/core), everybody is invited to come and share ideas, issues or simply get in touch.\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-broadcast is licensed under

src='/assets/screenshot.jpg' height='300px'>\n\n## Get started\n\n```\nbotpress install subscription\n```\n\nThe subscription module should now be available in your bot UI, and the APIs exposed.\n\n## Features\n\n### Multi-subscriptions\n\nYour bot can offer many categories of subscriptions, for example:\n> `NEWSLETTER`, `ALERTS`, `DAILY_REMINDERS_9AM`, `DAILY_REMINDERS_6PM`\n\nYour users can subscribe and unsubscribe to one or many of these subscriptions.\n\n### Custom keywords to Subscribe and Unsubscribe to subscriptions\n\nOne or many keywords can be defined to automatically handle subscription and unsubscription. \n\n**Note**: Keywords must match excatly and are case sensitive. Keywords match on any event, whether it is text or quick_replies or postback for example.\n\nTo handle subscription and unsubscription manually, see the APIs below.\n\n### Custom actions on Subscribed and Unsubscribed events\n\nVariables exposed to the action functions:\n- `bp` botpress instance\n- `event` the original middleware event that triggered the action\n- `userId` the userId to send the message to\n- `platform` the platform on which the user is on\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\nbp.messenger.sendText(eventId, `${event.user.first_name} thanks, you're subscribed`)\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### `GET /api/botpress-subscription/subscriptions`\n\nReturns a list of all the subscriptions.\n\n### `PUT /api/botpress-subscription/subscriptions/:category`\n\nCreate a new subscription.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-subscription/subscriptions/:id`\n\nUpdate an existing subscription.\n\n```js\n{\n  category: 'string', // *required*, the name of the subscription\n  sub_keywords: 'array', // *required*, array of keywords (string)\n  unsub_keywords: 'array', // *required*, array of keywords (string)\n  sub_action: 'string', // *required*, the action, text or a javascript function\n  unsub_action: 'string', // *required*, the action, text or a javascript function\n  sub_action_type: 'string', // *required*, \"text\" or \"javascript\"\n  unsub_action_type: 'string' // *required*, \"text\" or \"javascript\"\n}\n```\n\n### `DELETE /api/botpress-subscription/subscriptions/:id`\n\nDelete an existing subscription and also unsubscribes all the users subscribed to this subscription.\n\n### `bp.subscribe(userId, category)` -> Promise\n\nSubscribes a user to the subscription\n\n### `bp.unsubscribe(userId, category)` -> Promise\n\nUnsubscribes a user from the subscription\n\n### `bp.isSubscribed(userId, category)` -> Promise(bool)\n\nSubscribes a user to the subscription\n\n### `bp.getSubscribed(userId)` -> Promise([categories...])\n\nReturns a list of the categories the user is subscribed to\n\n### Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nWe have a [Public Chatroom](https://gitter.im/botpress/core), everybody is invited to come and share ideas, issues or simply get in touch.\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-subscription is licensed under

Validate and Connect! \n\nTo see in details how to configure completly this module, videos are available on our Youtube Channel \\(soon\\).\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Profile](#profile)\n* [Text messages](#text-messages) \n* [Postbacks](#postbacks)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Referrals](#referrals)\n* [Quick replies](#quick-replies)\n* [Optins](#optins)\n* [Delivery](#delivery)\n* [Read](#read)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Templates](#templates)\n* [Quick replies](#quick-replies)\n* [Automatic typing indicator](#automatic-typing-indicator)\n* [Postbacks](#postbacks)\n* [Referrals](#referrals)\n* [Display Get Started](#display-get-started)\n* [Greeting message](#greeting-message)\n* [Persistent menu](#persistent-menu)\n* [Automatically mark as read](#automatically-mark-as-read)\n* [Trusted domains](#trusted-domains)\n* [Save users in DB](#save-users-in-db)\n* [Automatic profile lookup](#automatic-profile-lookup)\n* [Webhook security check](#webhook-security-check)\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Messenger event to be able to react to user's actions.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'facebook', type: 'postback', text: 'GET_STARTED' }, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.pipeText(event.user.id, 'Welcome on Botpress!!!')\n   }\n})\n```\n\nIn fact, this module preprocesses almost all types of message (message, attachment, postback, quick_reply, delivery, read, optin, referrals...) and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.\n\n```js\nbp.middlewares.sendIncoming({\n   platform: 'facebook',\n   type: 'message',\n   user: profile,\n   text: e.message.text,\n   raw: e\n})\n```\n\n#### Profile\n\nYou can acces to all user's profile information by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.\n\n```js\n{\n  id: profile.id,\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  gender: profile.gender,\n  timezone: profile.timezone,\n  locale: profile.locale\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`). \n\n#### Text messages\n\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Messenger platform with all specific information.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'message',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.text,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot\n\n```js\nbp.hear('hello')\n```\n\n#### Postbacks\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'postback',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.postback.payload,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Attachments\n\nThe original attachments messenger event. May contain multiple attachments. Individual attachments are also emmited individually (see Image, Video, File below)\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'attachments',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.attachments.length,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n##### Image\n\nIndividual Attachment extracted from the Attachments event.\n\nNote that Stickers, Thumbs Up, GIFs and Pictures are considered images too.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'image', // Same for 'video', 'file' and 'audio'\n  user: profile,\n  text: 'http://www.image.url',\n  raw: { type: 'image', payload: { url: '...' }}\n}\n```\n\n##### Audio\n##### Video\n##### File\n\nSame signature as `Image` above.\n\n#### Referrals\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'referral',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.referral.ref,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Quick Replies\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'quick_reply',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.quick_reply.payload,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Optins\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'optin',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.optin.ref,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Delivery\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'delivery',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.delivery.watermark,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Read\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'read',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.read.watermark,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n### Outgoing\n\nBy using our module, you can send anything you want to your users on Messenger. In fact, this module support all types of messenge that are available on Facebook (text, images, videos, audios, webviews...).\n\n### Text messages\n\nIn code, it is simple to send a message text to a specific users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/text-message)).\n\n#### `sendText(userId, text, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier. Usually, this `recipient_id` is available from input message.\n\n2. ` text ` (_String_): Text message that will be send to user.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain: \n- `quick_replies` which is an array of quick replies to attach to the message\n- `typing` indicator. true for automatic timing calculation or a number in milliseconds (turns off automatically)\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the text message that needs to be sent to Messenger platform. The promise resolves when the message was successfully sent to facebook, except if you set the `waitDelivery` or `waitRead` options.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst text = \"Select between these two options?\"\nconst options = {\n  quick_replies: [\n    {\n      content_type: \"text\",\n      title: \"Option 1\",\n      payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION_1\"\n    },\n    {\n      content_type:\"text\",\n      title:\"Option 2\",\n      payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION_2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  typing: true,\n  waitRead: true\n}\n\nbp.messenger.sendText(userId, text, options)\n.then(() => {\n  // the message was read because of `waitRead` option  \n})\n```\n\n### Attachments\n\nBy using this function, you can send any type of attachment to your users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/contenttypes)).\n\n#### `sendAttachment(userId, type, url, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier\n\n2. ` type ` (_String_): Specific type of  attachment can be `'audio'`, `'file'`, `'image'` or `'video'` \n\n3. ` url ` (_String_): Correspond to specific url of the attachment that need to be sent.\n\n4. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain:\n- `quick_replies`\n- `typing`\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the attachment that needs to be sent to Messenger platform.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst type = 'image'\nconst url = 'https://github.com/botpress/botpress/blob/master/images/botpress-dark.png?raw=true'\n\nbp.messenger.sendAttachment(userId, type, url)\n```\n\n### Templates\n\nBy using this module, it's easy to send any type of supported template to your users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/templates)).\n\n#### `sendTemplate(userId, payload, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier\n\n2. ` payload ` (_Object_): Specific `payload` object for your selected template. Actually, many types of template (button, generic, list, receipt...) are supported by Messenger.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contains:\n- `typing`\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the template that needs to be sent.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst payload = {\n    template_type: \"button\",\n    text: \"Have you seen our awesome website?\",\n    buttons: [\n        {\n            type: \"web_url\",\n            url: \"https://www.botpress.io\",\n            title: \"Show Website\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nbp.messenger.sendTemplate(userId, payload, { typing: 2000 })\n```\n\n#### Quick replies\nBy using `options` argument, you can easily add quick replies to text messages or attachments. \n\n```js\nconst options = {\n    quick_replies: [\n        {\n            content_type :\"text\",\n            title: \"Option\",\n            payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n``` \n\n// Automatic typing indicator\n\nAs quick replies, you can add an automatic typing indicator to your messages by adding `typing` to `options` argument.\n\n```js\nconst options = { typing: true }\n```\n\n\n#### Postbacks\n\nThis module support postbacks. Postbacks occur when a Postback button, Get Started button, Persistent menu or Structured Message is tapped ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/postback)).\n\n#### Referrals\n\nThis module also support referrals. In fact, the value of the `ref` parameter is passed by the server via webhook and we are able to access these referrals in parameters of input messages ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/referral)). \n\n#### Display Get Started\n\nTo active get started button on Messenger, users can modify display setting directly in user interface ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/get-started-button)).\n\n<img alt='Get started button' src='/assets/display-get-started.png' width='600px' />\n\n\n#### Greeting message\n\nDirectly in module view, users are able to modify greeting message ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/greeting-text)).\n\n\n<img alt='Greeting message' src='/assets/greeting-message.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Persistent menu\n\nUsers can directly modify persistent menu in module user interface. By using UI, it's possible to add, modify and remove items \\([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/persistent-menu)\\).\n\n<img alt='Persistent menu' src='/assets/persistent-menu.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Automatically mark as read\n\nDirectly in UI, users can setup if they want to automatically mark all messages as read ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/message-read)).\n\n<img alt='Mark as read' src='/assets/automatically-mark-as-read.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Trusted domains\n\nBy using UI, users can configure \\(add, modify and remove\\) trusted domains ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/domain-whitelisting)).\n\n<img alt='Trusted domains' src='/assets/trusted-domains.png' width='600px'/>\n\n#### Automatic profile lookup\n\nProfiles are automatically lookedup using Facebook Graph API. The profile of the user can be found in the incoming middleware events: `event.user`\n\nThe following properties are available: first_name, last_name, locale, gender, timezone.\n \n#### Save users in Database\n\nUsers are automatically persisted in the built-in botpress database using the built-in `bp.db.saveUser` function.\n\n#### Webhook security check\n\nbotpress-messenger verifies that requests really come from Facebook's servers by validating requests hash.\n\n## Example\n\n* Botpress examples \\(soon\\).\n* Youtube Channel \\(soon\\).\n\n### Community\n\nThere's a [public chatroom](http://www.gitter.im/botpress/core) where you are welcome to join and ask any question and even help others.\n\n### License\n\nbotpress-messenger is licensed under
